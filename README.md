Problems Encountered and Overcome
- Hardware limitations: Team member could not run unity.
  - Split up roles and devices, with the computer able to handle art software
- Varied tech stacks between members
  - Could not work on complex projects together due to a lack of shared understanding of the necessary concepts
- Working on ideas that turned out to be infeasible:
  - Shifted to an idea that did not require too much knowledge beyond team members's capabilities
- Hunger: Team members were hungry
  - We all walked to a food establishment together
